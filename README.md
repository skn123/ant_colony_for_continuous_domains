# Bank of metaheuristics
Accurate and comprehensible implementaton of multiple metaheuristics in a class hierarchy.
- Requirements:
  - Python 3.x
  - Numpy
  - Scipy

## Metaheuristics implemented until now:
- Ant colony optimization for continuous domains (Socha, 2006).
- Simulated annealing (Kirkpatrick, 1983), possibly with adaptive step-size (Martins, 2012)
- Particle swarm optimization (Kennedy, 1995), possibly with the adaptive inertia weight proposed by (Nickabadi, 2011)
